## vllmChat
I have been looking to learn vllm for a while, this is me doing that. I have created a simple interface for chatting with models. 
Currently it uses facebook opt-125m as the quickstart guide on vllm encourages, more features to come. 

`Currently supports`:
- Turn based chat
- Simple in memory conversation history
- Commands to see chat history, clear history, and view model params

`Features to come`:
- Model selection
- DB for memory / RAG
- More chat information
